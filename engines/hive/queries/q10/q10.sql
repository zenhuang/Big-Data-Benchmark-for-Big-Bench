FROM (--wrap in additional FOR(), because Sorting/distribute by with UDTF in select clause is not allowed
  SELECT extract_sentiment(pr_item_sk,pr_review_content) AS (item_sk, review_sentence, sentiment, sentiment_word)
  FROM product_reviews 
) extracted
DISTRIBUTE BY item_sk --item_sk is skewed, but we need to sort by it. Technically we just expect a deterministic global sorting and not clustering by item_sk...so we could distribute by pr_review_sk
SORT BY item_sk,review_sentence,sentiment,sentiment_word
